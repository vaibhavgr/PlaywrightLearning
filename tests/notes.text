Child window concept : 
In Playwright, there is NO concept called child window.
Playwright only knows PAGES.
One browser
One tab = one page
New tab opens = new page
So Playwright must be told:
👉 “Hey, I am about to open a new tab — please catch it.”
The ONLY pattern you need to remember ⭐
WAIT for new page + CLICK at the same time
We do this using Promise.all.

frames : 
If an element is inside an iframe, first go into the iframe, then find the element.
Playwright gives us 2 easy ways:
1️⃣ frameLocator() 
2️⃣ frame() / contentFrame()
