Child window concept : 
In Playwright, there is NO concept called child window.
Playwright only knows PAGES.
One browser
One tab = one page
New tab opens = new page
So Playwright must be told:
👉 “Hey, I am about to open a new tab — please catch it.”
The ONLY pattern you need to remember ⭐
WAIT for new page + CLICK at the same time
We do this using Promise.all.
